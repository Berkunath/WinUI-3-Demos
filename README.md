These are some samples to demonstrate the usage of WinUI 3

## Configure your dev environment

Ensure that your development computer has Windows 10, version 1803 (build 17134), or a later version installed. WinUI 3 for desktop apps requires 1803 or a later OS version.

### 1) Install Visual Studio 2019, version 16.7 Preview 1

Install Visual Studio 2019, version 16.7 Preview 1. You can download this from  [Visual Studio Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview).

You must include the following workloads when installing the Visual Studio Preview:

- .NET Desktop Development
- Universal Windows Platform development

To build C++ apps you must also include the following workloads:

- Desktop development with C++
- The *C++ (v142) Universal Windows Platform tools* optional component for the Universal Windows Platform workload

### 2) Install .NET 5 Preview 4

Install both x64 and x86 versions of .NET 5 Preview 4:

- x64: [https://aka.ms/dotnet/net5/preview4/Sdk/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.exe](https://aka.ms/dotnet/net5/preview4/Sdk/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.exe)
- x86: [https://aka.ms/dotnet/net5/preview4/Sdk/dotnet-sdk-win-x86.exe](https://aka.ms/dotnet/net5/preview4/Sdk/dotnet-sdk-win-x86.exe)

### 3) Install WinUI 3 Preview 1 Visual Studio project templates

To access the WinUI 3.0 Preview 1 and project templates, go to **https://aka.ms/winui3/previewdownload**

Download the Visual Studio Extension (`.vsix`) to add the WinUI project templates and NuGget package to Visual Studio 2019 and install it. After installing the `.vsix` extension you can load these samples.
